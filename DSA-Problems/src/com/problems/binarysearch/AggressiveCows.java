//			There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows.

//			We want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. 
//			What is the largest minimum distance?
//
//			Examples:
//
//			Input: No of stalls = 5 
//			       Array: {1,2,8,4,9}
//			       And number of cows: 3
//
//			Output: One integer, the largest minimum distance 3
